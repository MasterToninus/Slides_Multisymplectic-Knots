abstract = {In this note we construct a homotopy co-momentum map ([8, 56, 57]) trangressing to the standard hydrodynamical co-momentum map of Arnol'd, Marsden and Weinstein and others, then generalized to a special class of Riemannian manifolds. As a byproduct, a covariant phase space interpretation of Brylinski's manifold of mildly singular links is exhibited upon resorting to the Euler equation for perfect fluids. A semiclassical interpretation of the HOMFLYPT polynomial is also given, building on the Liu-Ricca hydrodynamical approach to the latter and on the Besana- S. symplectic approach to framing. We finally reinterpret the (Massey) higher order linking numbers in terms of conserved quantities within the multisymplectic framework and determine knot theoretic analogues of first integrals in involution.},

@article{Rogers2010,
abstract = {A manifold is multisymplectic, or more specifically n-plectic, if it is equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential form of degree n+1. In our previous work with Baez and Hoffnung, we described how the `higher analogs' of the algebraic and geometric structures found in symplectic geometry should naturally arise in 2-plectic geometry. In particular, we showed that just as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, any 2-plectic manifold gives a Lie 2-algebra of 1-forms and functions. Lie n-algebras are examples of L-infinity algebras: graded vector spaces which are equipped with a collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a generalized Jacobi identity. Here, we generalize our previous result. Given an n-plectic manifold, we explicitly construct a corresponding Lie n-algebra on a complex consisting of differential forms whose multi-brackets are specified by the n-plectic structure. We also show that any n-plectic manifold gives rise to another kind of algebraic structure known as a differential graded Leibniz algebra. We conclude by describing the similarities between these two structures within the context of an open problem in the theory of strongly homotopy algebras.},

@article{Callies2016,
abstract = {Associated to any manifold equipped with a closed form of degree {\textgreater}1 is an ‘L$\infty$-algebra of observables' which acts as a higher/homotopy analog of the Poisson algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold. In order to study Lie group actions on these manifolds, we introduce a theory of homotopy moment maps. Such a map is a L$\infty$-morphism from the Lie algebra of the group into the observables which lifts the infinitesimal action. We establish the relationship between homotopy moment maps and equivariant de Rham cohomology, and analyze the obstruction theory for the existence of such maps. This allows us to easily and explicitly construct a large number of examples. These include results concerning group actions on loop spaces and moduli spaces of flat connections. Relationships are also established with previous work by others in classical field theory, algebroid theory, and dg geometry. Furthermore, we use our theory to geometrically construct various L$\infty$-algebras as higher central extensions of Lie algebras, in analogy with Kostant's quantization theory. In particular, the so-called ‘string Lie 2-algebra' arises this way.},

Quantization introduces in the theory in natural way the structure of the infinite Lie algebra of incompressible flows. We argue that all the topological invariants of the vortex, considered as a knot, can be regarded as observables of the system. Finally unitary representations of measure preserving flows on R3 and current algebra are discussed."

@article{Kleckner2013,
abstract = {Knots and links have been conjectured to play a fundamental role in a wide range of physical fields, including plasmas and fluids, both quantum and classical. In fluids, the fundamental knottedness-carrying excitations occur in the form of linked and knotted vortex loops, which have been conjectured to exist for over a century. Although they have been the subject of considerable theoretical study, their creation in the laboratory has remained an outstanding experimental goal. Here we report the creation of isolated trefoil vortex knots and pairs of linked vortex rings in water using a new method of accelerating specially shaped hydrofoils. Using a high-speed scanning tomography apparatus, we measure their three-dimensional topological and geometrical evolution in detail. In both cases we observe that the linked vortices stretch themselves and then deform—as dictated by their geometrically determined energy—towards a series of local vortex reconnections. This work establishes the existence and dynamics of knotted vortices in real fluids.},

@article{Ryvkin2016,
abstract = {Given a vector field on a manifold M, we define a globally conserved quantity to be a differential form whose Lie derivative is exact. Integrals of conserved quantities over suitable submanifolds are constant under time evolution, the Kelvin circulation theorem being a well-known special case. More generally, conserved quantities are well-behaved under transgression to spaces of maps into M. We focus on the case of multisymplectic manifolds and Hamiltonian vector fields. We show that in the presence of a Lie group of symmetries admitting a homotopy co-momentum map, one obtains a whole family of globally conserved quantities. This extends a classical result in symplectic geometry. We carry this out in a general setting, considering several variants of the notion of globally conserved quantity.},

The reconstruction presented here is entirely based on an accurate study of Gauss' own work on terrestrial magnetism. A brief discussion of a possibly independent derivation made by Maxwell in 1867 completes this reconstruction. Since the linking number interpretations in terms of degree, signed crossings and intersection index play such an important role in modern mathematical physics, we offer a direct proof of their equivalence. Explicit examples of its interpretation in terms of oriented area are also provided.},
